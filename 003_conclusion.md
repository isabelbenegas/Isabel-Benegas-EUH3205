# Conclusion

Throughout the 19th century, Europe witnessed extreme economic increase and technological advances due to the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution not only kickstarted the commonality of using machinery, but also was the cause for many ideologies that were developed due to the poor working conditions within the newfound factories. This led to the divide between the bourgeois and the working class, therefore changing the ideas that each group has for what would benefit society. Due to the unrest that this capitalistic society caused, it paved the way for the growth of Communism, which promoted a classless and utopian society.  Many workers used the ideas of Communism as an escape due to the unhappiness they were experiencing in their everyday life. Throughout the century, people's ideologies changed and expanded even past Communism and into Socialism, where more laws were introduced and put in place in order to protect labor rights, money, property, and welfare. These ideologies were introduced by many notable figures, the most prominent being Karl Marx, Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, Friedrich Engels, and Robert Owen. Each of these men played a role in promoting and expanding the ideologies of Communism and/or Socialism. These ideas didnâ€™t stay in one place, they spread throughout Europe and inspired many. This inspiration led to worker strikes across Europe, leading to new reforms and laws being implemented. The impact of these laws were seen for the rest of the 19th century and beyond. Europe was able to see a dramatic increase of rights within healthcare, safety, and working conditions. Without Capitalism and the Industrial Revolution, Communism and Socialism would have never affected Europe the way it did in the 19th century.
