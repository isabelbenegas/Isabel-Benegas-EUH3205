# Industrial revolution

  As European societies began to enter the 19th century, it became apparent that there was a distinct contrast of wealth among the upper and working classes. This divide became apparent among classes, especially the working class, and was continuously fueled by terrible working conditions that would result in equally worse living conditions. These conditions were permitted under the authoritative control of the factory owners, as well as laws that upheld factory owners’ demands were instated, leaving the working class with little rights. Perpetuated by the industrial revolution and factory owners’ dominance over wages, working hours and overall factory settings, a vast number of people suffered illnesses and even passed away under the watch of these establishments. While many people flocked from rural areas to cities with prospects of securing a job, it is evident that this new working class was unaware of the drastic changes that they would encounter in their new daily lives. Prior to factory life, the most common way a family unit would support themselves was to subsistence farm or develop a skill, such as a weaver or carpenter. This transition of labor was intended to provide people with a dependable job and a steady income, nonetheless, there is evidence that supports the notion of there being “no clear rise in the rates of upward mobility” among lower classes that have moved to the cities. While the implementation of factory life expanded the population and economy of many countries, this expansion created an environment that fostered the profits of the bourgeoisie, whilst the proletariat continued to suffer through inhumane working conditions. To combat this hardship, a rise of new ideologies and movements were sought out to prevent the capitalization of the working class through various social, political and economic reforms.
   With roots stemming from the rise of technological advancements, beginning in the late 18th century, the time of the Industrial revolution could be considered one of the most impactful periods in human history. Innovations made from these advancements had a massive effect on society as a whole, no matter what the class. One example of an important advancement in technology involves that of the steam engine. This new machinery allowed information to spread farther, and greatly increased the rate at which information was transferred globally. In addition, the continuous development of the power loom contributed to an increase in the rate at which clothes were made, which fueled textile businesses to open more factories and strengthen the size of their workforce incredibly. The owners of these factories and mills were typically middle-class men; and by constantly exploiting their workers they could boost their earnings and create revenue that was worth over ten times the rate that the factory workers were receiving in wages. Along with the continuous development of technology and many machines being regularly upgraded, machinery began to take away jobs from skilled workers. There were little options for these workers to confront their higher-ups and set boundaries, one alternative was to go on strike. Small-scale strikes across all areas of factory works began to rise in the beginning of the 19th century and eventually evolved into large-scale strikes. One example of this can be seen in St.Etienne, France, where many silk weavers expressed their distaste for the “pattern of capitalist development” they experienced while working in factories, resulting in protests throughout the mid 19th century. As resistance towards the bourgeoisie increased throughout the 1800s, the labor pool continued to grow, and it would be an up-hill battle before serious change would be implemented.  
  Along with this new extensive workforce came several issues including horrible factory conditions, extremely low wages and an overall absence of workers’ rights. Factory and mill workers were subjugated to long working hours, and towards the mid-19th century in England almost all factory workers were forced to spend around 12 hours in a regular working day, sometimes more. These long hours would be spent in a dark factory, with little to no sunlight or ventilation, all the while working in conditions with fast-paced machinery. Unfortunately, this led to many people having their arms or fingers amputated, as well as many people experiencing debilitating illnesses and irregular bodily functions from these circumstances. William Dean, a British surgeon, noted that there were signs of ‘swellings of the extremities’ and ‘deformities of the spine, thorax and lower extremities’ in many children that had been exposed to the factory environment. On top of the inadequate working conditions and child labor, another issue arose regarding the wages that many workers received. These wages were low and we're certainly not enough to support oneself or their family. By 1860, “the lowest 65 percent” of the population earned “about 29 percent of the total income in Britain”, emphasizing that a major portion of the revenue made went to the owners of the factory (Clark). The only way to legally combat these disadvantages would be to create or join a worker's union, however, several acts imposed by governments would be enforced to prevent these organizations so that owners could still receive profits. For instance, Combination Laws were introduced in Britain and supported the criminalization of striking, stating that “workmen are to be content with their wages” and should be restricted from “compelling their employers to raise it” (7). However, restricting basic rights of the employees who produce the goods and services needed to fund these higher socio-economic lifestyles would backfire immensely. It wouldn’t be until the late 19th century that the movement of unions would become more widespread and develop into organizations that brought change to the working class.  
  Overall, the industrial revolution’s impact on European societies in the 19th century transformed the way society functions as a whole. Even though many aspects of the industrial revolution were beneficial to the growth of economies and various nations, it simultaneously exploited the majority of the population to harsh working and living conditions. This cycle of exploitation was the daily reality for this group of people, and combating the powers at hand through social reform was the only way to escape this experience. In general, the development of social reformation and other movements led the way for oppressed groups to overall create better lives for themselves and establish workers' rights to prevent this level of manipulation on a grand scale.
