# Industrial revolution

As European societies began to enter the 19th century, it became apparent that there was a distinct contrast of wealth among the upper and working classes. This divide became apparent among classes, especially the working class, and was continuously fueled by terrible working conditions that would result in equally worse living conditions. These conditions were permitted under the authoritative control of the factory owners, as well as laws that upheld factory owners’ demands were instated, leaving the working class with little rights. Perpetuated by the industrial revolution and factory owners’ dominance over wages, working hours and overall factory settings, a vast number of people suffered illnesses and even passed away under the watch of these establishments. While many people flocked from rural areas to cities with prospects of securing a job, it is evident that this new working class was unaware of the drastic changes that they would encounter in their new daily lives. Prior to factory life, the most common way a family unit would support themselves was to subsistence farm or develop a skill, such as a weaver or carpenter. This transition of labor was intended to provide people with a dependable job and a steady income, nonetheless, there is evidence that supports the notion of there being “no clear rise in the rates of upward mobility” among lower classes that have moved to the cities.[^1] While the implementation of factory life expanded the population and economy of many countries, this expansion created an environment that fostered the profits of the bourgeoisie, whilst the proletariat continued to suffer through inhumane working conditions. To combat this hardship, a rise of new ideologies and movements were sought out to prevent the capitalization of the working class through various social, political and economic reforms.
  
With roots stemming from the rise of technological advancements, beginning in the late 18th century, the time of the Industrial revolution could be considered one of the most impactful periods in human history. Innovations made from these advancements had a massive effect on society as a whole, no matter what the class. One example of an important advancement in technology involves that of the steam engine. This new machinery allowed information to spread farther, and greatly increased the rate at which information was transferred globally. In addition, the continuous development of the power loom contributed to an increase in the rate at which clothes were made, which fueled textile businesses to open more factories and strengthen the size of their workforce incredibly. The owners of these factories and mills were typically middle-class men; and by constantly exploiting their workers they could boost their earnings and create revenue that was worth over ten times the rate that the factory workers were receiving in wages. Along with the continuous development of technology and many machines being regularly upgraded, machinery began to take away jobs from skilled workers. There were little options for these workers to confront their higher-ups and set boundaries, one alternative was to go on strike. Small-scale strikes across all areas of factory works began to rise in the beginning of the 19th century and eventually evolved into large-scale strikes. One example of this can be seen in St.Etienne, France, where many silk weavers expressed their distaste for the “pattern of capitalist development” they experienced while working in factories, resulting in protests throughout the mid 19th century.[^2] As resistance towards the bourgeoisie increased throughout the 1800s, the labor pool continued to grow, and it would be an up-hill battle before serious change would be implemented.

Along with this new extensive workforce came several issues including horrible factory conditions, extremely low wages and an overall absence of workers’ rights. Factory and mill workers were subjugated to long working hours, and towards the mid-19th century in England almost all factory workers were forced to spend around 12 hours in a regular working day, sometimes more.[^3] These long hours would be spent in a dark factory, with little to no sunlight or ventilation, all the while working in conditions with fast-paced machinery. Unfortunately, this led to many people having their arms or fingers amputated, as well as many people experiencing debilitating illnesses and irregular bodily functions from these circumstances. William Dean, a British surgeon, noted that there were signs of ‘swellings of the extremities’ and ‘deformities of the spine, thorax and lower extremities’ in many children that had been exposed to the factory environment.[^4] On top of the inadequate working conditions and child labor, another issue arose regarding the wages that many workers received. These wages were low and we're certainly not enough to support oneself or their family. By 1860, “the lowest 65 percent” of the population earned “about 29 percent of the total income in Britain”, emphasizing that a major portion of the revenue made went to the owners of the factory.[^5] The only way to legally combat these disadvantages would be to create or join a worker's union, however, several acts imposed by governments would be enforced to prevent these organizations so that owners could still receive profits. For instance, Combination Laws were introduced in Britain and supported the criminalization of striking, stating that “workmen are to be content” and should be restricted from “compelling their employers to raise” their incomes.[^6] However, restricting basic rights of the employees who produce the goods and services needed to fund these higher socio-economic lifestyles would backfire immensely. It wouldn’t be until the late 19th century that the movement of unions would become more widespread and develop into organizations that brought change to the working class.  
  
Overall, the industrial revolution’s impact on European societies in the 19th century transformed the way society functions as a whole. Even though many aspects of the industrial revolution were beneficial to the growth of economies and various nations, it simultaneously exploited the majority of the population to harsh working and living conditions. This cycle of exploitation was the daily reality for this group of people, and combating the powers at hand through social reform was the only way to escape this experience. In general, the development of social reformation and other movements led the way for oppressed groups to overall create better lives for themselves and establish workers' rights to prevent this level of manipulation on a grand scale.  

# Socialist and Communist Ideologies

Spawning from the gripes commonly had with industrial capitalism were two new, distinct economic philosophies in socialism and communism. Socialism is often traced back to Henri de Saint-Simon, whose economic ideology is now referred to as Saint-Simonist socialism. After Saint-Simon, there was a wave of utopian socialism created from the ideas of those like Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. The ideas of socialists were later taken farther by Marx in the form of communism. The earliest definition of communism is found in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’s Communist Manifesto. In this manifesto, the authors define their ideal economic system for society as well as describing their problems with capitalism and socialism. 

## Socialism

Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon was born into French nobility in 1760, 29 years before the French Revolution. He released his first writings on socialism in 1817 with *L’Industrie,* although the word “socialism” wouldn’t be used to describe his ideology until after his death in 1825. While being surrounded by aristocracy throughout his life, he lost faith in their ability to govern the nation and rid himself of the “comte” title. Saint-Simon did not believe that democracy was the way forward either, as he didn’t see the general population as any more qualified than the nobles of the time. Instead, he vouched for a sort of technocracy, allowing scientific experts to rule society.[^7] When it came to ownership of factories and other institutions of labor, Saint-Simonians believed that the workers should own them, but that wealth produced by this work should be shared based on the skill of the workers rather than being spread equally.[^8] Saint-Simonian socialism varies from other forms of utopian socialism because of this focus on capability and intelligence to determine social standing and wealth.

The term “utopian socialism” was first seriously put into use by Friedrich Engels in his work *Socialism, Utopian and Scientific* to describe early forms of socialism that create an idea of a perfect society under socialism that does not seriously consider the ramifications of their application.[^9] Thinkers like Robert Owen and Charles Fourier have since been given the title of “utopian socialist” to describe their ideologies. In the late 18th and early 19th century, Owen benefited from industrial capitalism as a manager of a cotton-mill, but sought to reform society after feeling concern for the working class population. He believed that it was the circumstances of the individual that defined them, beyond our control, and that everyone held the capability to do good. He would go on to create his own utopia in the New Harmony colony in America, which ended up failing after only two years.[^10] 

Charles Fourier’s form of utopian socialism varied from Owen’s in their ideas of human nature, as Fourier believed that society should be built to serve human desires while Owen believed in education as a way to change human nature. Fourier’s philosophy was based on his idea of humans holding 12 common passions that all ultimately lead to the goal of mutual good for society. He was also a believer in the idea of communal ownership of property and wealth, which would later be more closely associated with communism. Fourier’s utopian ideas were specific in how he wanted society to be arranged in phalanges, with several attempts being made to create these societies, none being successful.[^11] Although “socialism” is a term used to describe a wide variety of economic and political ideologies, the beginnings of these ideologies are founded in the philosophies of Saint Simon, Robert Owen, and Charles Fourier.

## Communism

The rise of communism can be attributed to the spread of *The Communist Manifesto,* written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It was originally released in 1848, but only gained popularity in the 1870s.[^12] In *The Communist Manifesto,* the authors described how they saw the capitalist economic system, with the wealthy minority of the bourgeoisie holding power over the working class, or the proletariat. The *Manifesto* spoke to the feelings of the working class, describing the proletariat as a resource for the bourgeoisie to make money with.[^13] According to Marx and Engels, the growth of industry also increased the wealth and power of the bourgeoisie.[^14] Completely opposed to capitalism, communism instead suggests a system with no private property, the abolition of inheritance rights, and wage adjusted income tax.[^15]

*The Communist Manifesto* also describes the issues Marx and Engels had with socialism, seeing it as a stepping stone on the way to communism. The Manifesto goes over several different manifestations of socialism, with a common complaint that while socialism is able to recognize the struggle of the working class, these systems do not go far enough to fix the issues brought by industrial capitalism.[^16] Marx also had concerns with utopian forms of socialism specifically, as he felt that utopian socialists didn’t fully grasp the amount of work and struggle it would take to truly reach this type of society.[^17]

Immediately after the release of *The Communist Manifesto,* understandings of what communism was were limited. Communism was often confused with socialism, and Marx and Engels themselves even accepted the title of “socialist” when it was given to them, despite their belief that socialism was only a way to bridge the gap between capitalism and communism. The first ‘communist party’ would only be born in 1918 Russia as the Bolsheviks came to power and adopted the name. This delayed reaction to the *Manifesto* could have been because of its lack of detail on how a communist society should be run, giving its readers little to work with if they wanted to implement a truly Marxist economic system. The *Manifesto* also didn’t fully account for the power that nationalism would have in preventing ideas like communism from spreading, as communism intended for citizens to have allegiance based on class rather than based on nationality.[^18]

Although communism itself would take time to implement in the economic systems of European countries, the ideas of giving power to laborers were highly influential. Because of the spread of socialist and communist ideas throughout 19th-century Europe, labor movements would rise as workers felt emboldened by these new ideas and held anger towards the system of industrial capitalism that they resided under. 

# Rise in socialism and communism’s popularity, people's reaction to communist/socialist ideas, and how they affected Europe

With the terrible working conditions in industrialized centers, much of the working class began to feel a deepening frustration with their aristocratic, conservative regimes. This was likely in part due to their perception that these regimes were enabling capitalists to exploit them. This frustration, along with the proliferation of enlightenment ideas such as nationalism, led to the revolutions of 1848—all of which were ultimately crushed. What was not crushed, however, were the leftwing ideas that caused these revolutions. It was during this same year that Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote the Communist Manifesto. The manifesto detailed the declining individuality of the worker and the poor conditions they experience under capitalism. Marx and Engels also theorized the eventual overthrowing of the bourgeoisie, the abolition of private property, and the creation of a classless society. Hence, the Communist Manifesto resonated with much of the working class since they could relate to the conditions of working in a capitalist society, along with the utopian-sounding nature of a classless society.[^19] In addition to the Communist Manifesto’s popularity, the European governments’ efforts to suppress labor movements oftentimes led to workers espousing more radical ideas when they met with failure. As will be described later in this section, Germany’s anti-Socialist laws had this same effect. Even when countries attempted to address the problems associated with capitalism, they would still lead to people turning to socialism and communism. Sometimes, these attempts at reform would go too slowly or just not resolve the underlying issues. Radical solutions, therefore, were seen as being more prudent for if real change were to be achieved.[^20]

## The Paris Commune

{% assign media = site.media_metadata | where_exp: "item", "item.name == 'Communeparis'" %} {% include media.html pages=media %}

In 1871, communist theory was put into praxis when the French national guard guarding Paris during the Franco-Prussian War seized power and established the Paris Commune. The Commune instituted several reforms, such as the separation of church and state, limited socialization of the means of production, and social welfare.[^21] The Commune only lasted for a few months, but it proved to be quite influential. First, it showed that a path toward communism was possible. It demonstrated that workers could seize power and govern, thus demonstrating that it was possible for a “dictatorship of the proletariat.” In Marxism, a dictatorship of the proletariat is part of the transitional phase from a capitalist society to a communist society.[^22] Furthermore, the Commune also increased the popularity of communism. If there is an insurrection in the capital of one of the most powerful countries in Europe and the World, people are undoubtedly going to hear about it. Hence, their deeds and ideas were able to reach a much broader audience.[^23] The Paris Commune is a prime example of how communism was in direct response to capitalism. As established earlier, the Industrial Revolution created poor living conditions for workers. It arguably led to workers being exploited and, as Marx claimed, was depriving people of their individuality since they had effectively become slaves of the machines they were operating. Their work lacked any soul.[^24] The Paris Commune demonstrates that much of the working people of Paris had enough of their circumstances. They figured that the best chance to enact change was in the midst of a war that was on track to change the balance of power in Europe. If the balance of power in Europe was to change in Europe between nations, then they may as well change the balance of power in their nation’s politics—this time in favor of the worker. The influence of the Paris Commune reflects the increasing discontent with the state of capitalism in both France and Europe at the time due to how readily people were willing to embrace its ideas. 

## Germany

In Germany, socialist and communist sentiment was also brewing. The 1875 Gotha Program united two socialist factions, with those being the SDAP (Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands), who were “Eisenachers” and ADAV (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiter-Verein), who were “Lassalleans”. The two united at this program to create a united socialist front. The Congress of Gotha showed the German government the strength of their movement. In fact, this led to the 1875-1876 session of the Reichstag to check the growth of socialism.[^25] It is worth noting that this occurred just four years after the Paris Commune. It is quite likely that the Commune may have popularized communism a fair amount in Germany. When Kaiser Wilhelm I faced two assassination attempts in 1878, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck took it as an opportunity to push through the Anti-Socialist laws with the justification that one of the assassins was a former member of the Socialist Workers’ Party of Germany (SAPD).[^26] Of course, the justification for these laws was quite flimsy since the assassin who was formerly in the SAPD was only in it briefly and reportedly spoke out against socialism,[^27] while the other assassin was an anarchist.[^28] The primary goal of the Anti-Socialist laws was to curb socialist and communist sympathies, which included clamping down on the SAPD. As a result of these laws, the SAPD would be effectively banned. After passing the Anti-Socialist laws, Bismarck then tried to appease socialists by passing several laws throughout the 1880s that provided insurance for health, accidents, disability, and old age. This appeasement served to make socialists more loyal to the state.[^29] The fact that he needed to appease them in the first place shows how much momentum the socialist movement had. Ultimately, the Anti-Socialist Laws ended up having quite the opposite effect. The popularity of socialism and communism greatly increased. By attempting to suppress an already popular movement, it created an outrage that only drew further attention to the cause. People were still able to express their socialist ideas through loopholes, albeit with resistance from the state. Even though Bismarck attempted to win over socialist and communist sympathizers with the insurance laws throughout the 1880s, it was clearly not working. Thus, Bismarck resorted to repealing the Anti-Socialist Laws in 1890. When the SPD reformed, it became even stronger than when it last existed.[^30] This forced Bismarck to side with the Catholic Center Party, who he had previously worked against.[^31] It was thus clear that there was growing discontent with a capitalist society. Not only did many workers live in poor conditions, but now it appeared that the state was working against them. This likely made them feel vindicated in their beliefs and strengthened their resolve.
