# Industrial revolution

As European societies began to enter the 19th century, it became apparent that there was a distinct contrast of wealth among the upper and working classes. This divide became apparent among classes, especially the working class, and was continuously fueled by terrible working conditions that would result in equally worse living conditions. These conditions were permitted under the authoritative control of the factory owners, as well as laws that upheld factory owners’ demands were instated, leaving the working class with little rights. Perpetuated by the industrial revolution and factory owners’ dominance over wages, working hours and overall factory settings, a vast number of people suffered illnesses and even passed away under the watch of these establishments. While many people flocked from rural areas to cities with prospects of securing a job, it is evident that this new working class was unaware of the drastic changes that they would encounter in their new daily lives. Prior to factory life, the most common way a family unit would support themselves was to subsistence farm or develop a skill, such as a weaver or carpenter. This transition of labor was intended to provide people with a dependable job and a steady income, nonetheless, there is evidence that supports the notion of there being “no clear rise in the rates of upward mobility”[^1] among lower classes that have moved to the cities. While the implementation of factory life expanded the population and economy of many countries, this expansion created an environment that fostered the profits of the bourgeoisie, whilst the proletariat continued to suffer through inhumane working conditions. To combat this hardship, a rise of new ideologies and movements were sought out to prevent the capitalization of the working class through various social, political and economic reforms.
  
With roots stemming from the rise of technological advancements, beginning in the late 18th century, the time of the Industrial revolution could be considered one of the most impactful periods in human history. Innovations made from these advancements had a massive effect on society as a whole, no matter what the class. One example of an important advancement in technology involves that of the steam engine. This new machinery allowed information to spread farther, and greatly increased the rate at which information was transferred globally. In addition, the continuous development of the power loom contributed to an increase in the rate at which clothes were made, which fueled textile businesses to open more factories and strengthen the size of their workforce incredibly. The owners of these factories and mills were typically middle-class men; and by constantly exploiting their workers they could boost their earnings and create revenue that was worth over ten times the rate that the factory workers were receiving in wages. Along with the continuous development of technology and many machines being regularly upgraded, machinery began to take away jobs from skilled workers. There were little options for these workers to confront their higher-ups and set boundaries, one alternative was to go on strike. Small-scale strikes across all areas of factory works began to rise in the beginning of the 19th century and eventually evolved into large-scale strikes. One example of this can be seen in St.Etienne, France, where many silk weavers expressed their distaste for the “pattern of capitalist development” they experienced while working in factories, resulting in protests throughout the mid 19th century.[^2] As resistance towards the bourgeoisie increased throughout the 1800s, the labor pool continued to grow, and it would be an up-hill battle before serious change would be implemented.  
   
Along with this new extensive workforce came several issues including horrible factory conditions, extremely low wages and an overall absence of workers’ rights. Factory and mill workers were subjugated to long working hours, and towards the mid-19th century in England almost all factory workers were forced to spend around 12 hours in a regular working day, sometimes more.[^3] These long hours would be spent in a dark factory, with little to no sunlight or ventilation, all the while working in conditions with fast-paced machinery. Unfortunately, this led to many people having their arms or fingers amputated, as well as many people experiencing debilitating illnesses and irregular bodily functions from these circumstances. William Dean, a British surgeon, noted that there were signs of ‘swellings of the extremities’ and ‘deformities of the spine, thorax and lower extremities’ in many children that had been exposed to the factory environment.[^4] On top of the inadequate working conditions and child labor, another issue arose regarding the wages that many workers received. These wages were low and we're certainly not enough to support oneself or their family. By 1860, “the lowest 65 percent” of the population earned “about 29 percent of the total income in Britain”, emphasizing that a major portion of the revenue made went to the owners of the factory (Clark). The only way to legally combat these disadvantages would be to create or join a worker's union, however, several acts imposed by governments would be enforced to prevent these organizations so that owners could still receive profits. For instance, Combination Laws were introduced in Britain and supported the criminalization of striking, stating that “workmen are to be content with their wages” and should be restricted from “compelling their employers to raise it” (7). However, restricting basic rights of the employees who produce the goods and services needed to fund these higher socio-economic lifestyles would backfire immensely. It wouldn’t be until the late 19th century that the movement of unions would become more widespread and develop into organizations that brought change to the working class.  
  
Overall, the industrial revolution’s impact on European societies in the 19th century transformed the way society functions as a whole. Even though many aspects of the industrial revolution were beneficial to the growth of economies and various nations, it simultaneously exploited the majority of the population to harsh working and living conditions. This cycle of exploitation was the daily reality for this group of people, and combating the powers at hand through social reform was the only way to escape this experience. In general, the development of social reformation and other movements led the way for oppressed groups to overall create better lives for themselves and establish workers' rights to prevent this level of manipulation on a grand scale.  

# Socialism

Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon was born into French nobility in 1760, 29 years before the French Revolution. He released his first writings on socialism in 1817 with L’Industrie, although the word “socialism” wouldn’t be used to describe his ideology until after his death in 1825. While being surrounded by aristocracy throughout his life, he lost faith in their ability to govern the nation and rid himself of the “comte” title. Saint-Simon did not believe that democracy was the way forward either, as he didn’t see the general population as any more qualified than the nobles of the time. Instead, he vouched for a sort of technocracy, allowing scientific experts to rule society.[^5] When it came to ownership of factories and other institutions of labor, Saint-Simonians believed that the workers should own them, but that wealth produced by this work should be shared based on the skill of the workers rather than being spread equally.[^6] Saint-Simonian socialism varies from other forms of utopian socialism because of this focus on capability and intelligence to determine social standing and wealth.

The term “utopian socialism” was first seriously put into use by Friedrich Engels in his work Socialism, Utopian and Scientific to describe early forms of socialism that create an idea of a perfect society under socialism that does not seriously consider the ramifications of their application.[^7] Thinkers like Robert Owen and Charles Fourier have since been given the title of “utopian socialist” to describe their ideologies. In the late 18th and early 19th century, Owen benefited from industrial capitalism as a manager of a cotton-mill, but sought to reform society after feeling concern for the working class population. He believed that it was the circumstances of the individual that defined them, beyond our control, and that everyone held the capability to do good. He would go on to create his own utopia in the New Harmony colony in America, which ended up failing after only two years.[^8] 

Charles Fourier’s form of utopian socialism varied from Owen’s in their ideas of human nature, as Fourier believed that society should be built to serve human desires while Owen believed in education as a way to change human nature. Fourier’s philosophy was based on his idea of humans holding 12 common passions that all ultimately lead to the goal of mutual good for society. He was also a believer in the idea of communal ownership of property and wealth, which would later be more closely associated with communism. Fourier’s utopian ideas were specific in how he wanted society to be arranged in phalanges, with several attempts being made to create these societies, none being successful.[^9] Although “socialism” is a term used to describe a wide variety of economic and political ideologies, the beginnings of these ideologies are founded in the philosophies of Saint Simon, Robert Owen, and Charles Fourier.

# Communism

The rise of communism can be attributed to the spread of The Communist Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It was originally released in 1848, but only gained popularity in the 1870s.[^10] In The Communist Manifesto, the authors described how they saw the capitalist economic system, with the wealthy minority of the bourgeoisie holding power over the working class, or the proletariat. The Manifesto spoke to the feelings of the working class, describing the proletariat as a resource for the bourgeoisie to make money with.[^11] According to Marx and Engels, the growth of industry also increased the wealth and power of the bourgeoisie.[^12] Completely opposed to capitalism, communism instead suggests a system with no private property, the abolition of inheritance rights, and wage adjusted income tax.[^13]

The Communist Manifesto also describes the issues Marx and Engels had with socialism, seeing it as a stepping stone on the way to communism. The Manifesto goes over several different manifestations of socialism, with a common complaint that while socialism is able to recognize the struggle of the working class, these systems do not go far enough to fix the issues brought by industrial capitalism.[^14] Marx also had concerns with utopian forms of socialism specifically, as he felt that utopian socialists didn’t fully grasp the amount of work and struggle it would take to truly reach this type of society.[^15]

Immediately after the release of The Communist Manifesto, understandings of what communism was were limited. Communism was often confused with socialism, and Marx and Engels themselves even accepted the title of “socialist” when it was given to them, despite their belief that socialism was only a way to bridge the gap between capitalism and communism. The first ‘communist party’ would only be born in 1918 Russia as the Bolsheviks came to power and adopted the name. This delayed reaction to the Manifesto could have been because of its lack of detail on how a communist society should be run, giving its readers little to work with if they wanted to implement a truly Marxist economic system. The Manifesto also didn’t fully account for the power that nationalism would have in preventing ideas like communism from spreading, as communism intended for citizens to have allegiance based on class rather than based on nationality.[^16]

Although communism itself would take time to implement in the economic systems of European countries, the ideas of giving power to laborers were highly influential. Because of the spread of socialist and communist ideas throughout 19th-century Europe, labor movements would rise as workers felt emboldened by these new ideas and held anger towards the system of industrial capitalism that they resided under.
