# Introduction

The Industrial Revolution introduced technological advancements and transformed Europe in the 19th century. Europe had unprecedented economic growth and technological innovation. New machinery and production advancements revolutionized various industries, such as textiles, steel, and transportation, making goods possible to be produced cheaper and faster. Urban centers expanded rapidly as people moved to cities searching for work, which fueled economic expansion and generated economic growth. However, this rapid change brought widespread social discontent, with the exploitation of workers, child labor, and unsafe working conditions. The shift in the economy and the new industrialized cities created a new class of factory workers who faced difficult conditions: long hours, low wages, and an unsafe working environment, which became the new normal for the working class. The contrasting life of the working class and the bourgeoisie fueled the resentment and highlighted societal inequalities. This discontent made way for new ideologies that aimed to address and fix this social inequality. These new ideologies aimed at addressing the flaws of the capitalist system. Socialism and communism were the most contrasting ideologies that critiqued the capitalist system, offering an alternative way to organize society. This paper argues the contradictions and tensions within capitalism and the new ideologies that emerged as a transformative ideology in 19th-century Europe.[^1]
